           <h1 style="font-weight:bold,font-size:40">What are crochets?</h1>
           <p style="font-size:20">Crochet is a craft that involves creating fabric by
           interlocking loops of yarn using a hooked  needle. Unlike
           knitting,
           which uses two needles, crochet requires only one, making it simpler
           for many beginners to learn. It is a highly versatile technique used
           to make a wide range of items including clothing, accessories, home
           décor, and toys. One of the most popular aspects of crochet is its
           creative freedom—crafters can experiment with different yarn colors,
           textures, and stitches to create unique pieces. The basic stitches,
           such as chain, single crochet, and double crochet, serve as building
           blocks for more complex patterns. Crochet is not just a hobby but
           also a form of mindfulness and stress relief for many people,
           providing a calming and rewarding experience. Over time, it has grown
           from a domestic art into a modern fashion and artistic movement, with
           online communities, tutorials, and social media helping to connect
           crocheters around the world. Many artisans even sell their handmade
           crochet items, turning their passion into a small business. Whether
           done as a relaxing pastime or a serious craft, crochet continues to
           inspire creativity and connection through the simple yet beautiful
           act of looping yarn into art.
